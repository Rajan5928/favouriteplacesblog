        <p><b>Amsterdam Netherlands</b></p>
        <p id="amsterdam">Amsterdam (/ˈæmstərdæm/, UK also /ˌæmstərˈdæm/;[10][11] Dutch: [ɑmstərˈdɑm] (About this soundlisten)) is the capital and
        most populous city of the Netherlands, with a population of 866,737 within the city proper, 1,380,872 in the urban
        area,[5] and 2,410,960 in the metropolitan area.[9] Amsterdam is in the province of North Holland.[12][13] Amsterdam is
        colloquially referred to as the "Venice of the North" due to its large number of canals which are a UNESCO World
        Heritage Site.
        
        Amsterdam's name derives from Amstelredamme,[14] indicative of the city's origin around a dam in the river Amstel.
        Originating as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important ports in the
        world in the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century and became the leading centre for finance and trade.[15] In the 19th
        and 20th centuries, the city expanded, and many new neighbourhoods and suburbs were planned and built. The 17th-century
        canals of Amsterdam and the 19–20th century Defence Line of Amsterdam are on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Sloten,
        annexed in 1921 by the municipality of Amsterdam, is the oldest part of the city, dating to the 9th century.
        
        As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centres in Europe, Amsterdam is considered an
        alpha-world city by the Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) study group. The city is also the cultural capital of the
        Netherlands.[16] Many large Dutch institutions have their headquarters there, including Philips, AkzoNobel, TomTom and
        ING.[17] Also, many of the world's largest companies are based in Amsterdam or have established their European
        headquarters in the city, such as leading technology companies Uber, Netflix and Tesla.[18] In 2012, Amsterdam was
        ranked the second best city to live in by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)[19] and 12th globally on quality of
        living for environment and infrastructure by Mercer.[20] The city was ranked 4th place globally as top tech hub in the
        Savills Tech Cities 2019 report (2nd in Europe),[21] and 3rd in innovation by Australian innovation agency 2thinknow in
        their Innovation Cities Index 2009.[22] The Port of Amsterdam is the fifth largest in Europe.[23] Famous Amsterdam
        residents include the diarist Anne Frank, artists Rembrandt and Van Gogh, and philosopher Baruch Spinoza.
        
        The Amsterdam Stock Exchange is the oldest stock exchange in the world. Amsterdam's main attractions include its
        historic canals, the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, the Stedelijk Museum, Hermitage Amsterdam, the Concertgebouw, the
        Anne Frank House, the Scheepvaartmuseum, the Amsterdam Museum, the Heineken Experience, the Royal Palace of Amsterdam,
        Natura Artis Magistra, Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam, NEMO, the red-light district and many cannabis coffee shops. They
        draw more than 5 million international visitors annually.[24] The city is also well known for its nightlife and festival
        activity; several of its nightclubs (Melkweg, Paradiso) are among the world's most famous. It is also one of the world's
        most multicultural cities, with at least 177 nationalities represented.</p>
