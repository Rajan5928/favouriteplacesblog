        <p><b>Santorini Islands Greece</b></p>
        <p id="santorini">Santorini (Greek: Σαντορίνη, pronounced [sandoˈrini]), officially Thira (Greek: Θήρα [ˈθira]) and classic Greek Thera
        (English pronunciation /ˈθɪərə/), is an island in the southern Aegean Sea, about 200 km (120 mi) southeast of Greece's
        mainland. It is the largest island of a small, circular archipelago, which bears the same name and is the remnant of a
        volcanic caldera. It forms the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands, with an area of approximately 73
        km2 (28 sq mi) and a 2011 census population of 15,550. The municipality of Santorini includes the inhabited islands of
        Santorini and Therasia, as well as the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni, Palaia Kameni, Aspronisi and Christiana. The
        total land area is 90.623 km2 (34.990 sq mi).[2] Santorini is part of the Thira regional unit.[3]
        
        The island was the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history: the Minoan eruption (sometimes
        called the Thera eruption), which occurred about 3,600 years ago at the height of the Minoan civilization.[4] The
        eruption left a large caldera surrounded by volcanic ash deposits hundreds of metres deep. It may have led indirectly to
        the collapse of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete, 110 km (68 mi) to the south, through a gigantic tsunami.
        Another popular theory holds that the Thera eruption is the source of the legend of Atlantis.[5]
        
        It is the most active volcanic centre in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc, though what remains today is chiefly a
        water-filled caldera. The volcanic arc is approximately 500 km (310 mi) long and 20 to 40 km (12 to 25 mi) wide. The
        region first became volcanically active around 3–4 million years ago[citation needed], though volcanism on Thera began
        around 2 million years ago with the extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around Akrotiri.</p>
