        <p id="colorado">Colorado (/ˌkɒləˈrædoʊ, -ˈrɑːdoʊ/ (About this soundlisten), other variants)[8][9][10] is a state of the Western United
        States encompassing most of the southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and
        the western edge of the Great Plains. It is the 8th most extensive and 21st most populous U.S. state. The estimated
        population of Colorado was 5,695,564 on July 1, 2018, an increase of 13.25% since the 2010 United States Census.[11]
        
        The state was named for the Colorado River, which early Spanish explorers named the Río Colorado for the ruddy silt the
        river carried from the mountains. The Territory of Colorado was organized on February 28, 1861,[12] and on August 1,
        1876, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant signed Proclamation 230 admitting Colorado to the Union as the 38th state.[2]
        Colorado is nicknamed the "Centennial State" because it became a state one century after the signing of the United
        States Declaration of Independence.
        
        Colorado is bordered by Wyoming to the north, Nebraska to the northeast, Kansas to the east, Oklahoma to the southeast,
        New Mexico to the south, Utah to the west, and touches Arizona to the southwest at the Four Corners. Colorado is noted
        for its vivid landscape of mountains, forests, high plains, mesas, canyons, plateaus, rivers and desert lands. Colorado
        is part of the western and southwestern United States, and is one of the Mountain States.
        
        Denver is the capital and most populous city of Colorado. Residents of the state are known as Coloradans, although the
        antiquated term "Coloradoan" is occasionally used.</p>
