        <p id="kyryzstan">Kyrgyzstan (/ˌkɜːrɡɪˈstɑːn/ KUR-gih-STAHN;[8] Kyrgyz: Кыргызстан Kırğızstan (Kyrgyz pronunciation: [qɯrʁɯsˈstɑn]),
        officially the Kyrgyz Republic (Kyrgyz: Кыргыз Республикасы, romanized: Kırğız Respublikası; Russian: Кыргызская
        Республика, tr. Kyrgyzskaya Respublika), and also known as Kirghizia (Russian: Киргизия [kʲɪrˈɡʲizʲɪjə]),[9] is a
        country in Central Asia.[10] Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked country with mountainous terrain. It is bordered by Kazakhstan
        to the north, Uzbekistan to the west and southwest, Tajikistan to the southwest and China to the east. Its capital and
        largest city is Bishkek.
        
        Kyrgyzstan's recorded history spans over 2,000 years, encompassing a variety of cultures and empires. Although
        geographically isolated by its highly mountainous terrain, which has helped preserve its ancient culture, Kyrgyzstan has
        been at the crossroads of several great civilizations as part of the Silk Road and other commercial and cultural routes.
        Though long inhabited by a succession of independent tribes and clans, Kyrgyzstan has periodically fallen under foreign
        domination and attained sovereignty as a nation-state only after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.
        
        Since independence, the sovereign state has officially been a unitary parliamentary republic, although it continues to
        endure ethnic conflicts,[11][12] revolts,[13] economic troubles,[14][15] transitional governments[16] and political
        conflict.[17] Kyrgyzstan is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Eurasian Economic Union, the
        Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation,
        the Turkic Council, the Türksoy community and the United Nations.
        
        Ethnic Kyrgyz make up the majority of the country's six million people, followed by significant minorities of Uzbeks and
        Russians. Kyrgyz is closely related to other Turkic languages, although Russian remains widely spoken and is an official
        language, a legacy of a century of Russification. The majority of the population are non-denominational Muslims.[18] In
        addition to its Turkic origins, Kyrgyz culture bears elements of Persian, Mongolian, and Russian influence.</p>
